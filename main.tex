\section*{\Large Abstract}
\thispagestyle{plain}
               Megabolt is cross-platform download manger written in Qt Framework with many interesting features
                capable of professional use. Megabolt uses threaded downloaded on all the protocols it supports.
                The software is released in BSD licensed.\\

                Our project was mainly intended to write portable code that runs light-weight processes on various
                platforms that Qt supports and provides a simple front-end to initiate, configure and use the software.
                Extra care was given in making the software configurable. The data structures are generic that supports
                almost all file transfer protocols available right now in the industry.

\section{Introduction}
\setcounter{page}{1}
At this point of the century, internet is the largest source of data and file. When data holds something that is useful; the
data becomes information. Most of the worlds population uses internet for searching information and downloading files etc.
And there arises the need of a well architectured, designed and friendly download manager. Computer networks as designed,
the data is sent in the form of packets through various intervening routers and proxies.

A download manager is a software that are usually tailored to automate downloads of various files hosted in the internet. The
protocols with which the files may be shared may be HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, metalink or even cookie based connections. So it means that
we need a download manager that extends its service to operate over the above protocols and function efficiently. So we went on with
the idea of making one. But, after that we realized that the coding phase is going to be hectic. We, the developers of the software
wanted the software to be free in all its means because that is the only way to provide something best to the society to solve a common
problem. A more close look at the networking API of the modern system made it clear that the thread management is different for different
operating systems. Moreover the TCP/IP kernel stack is different from each other with incompatible extension and methods.

We needed a single code base that can be used to run in all the environments. Such thoughts made us to think of even using scripting
languages like python or perl for the software. Later, we got in touch with Nokia's Qt. Qt is widely used in many projects. Qt is a
extended C++ language. It has a middle interfacing template layer that interfaces all the devices and jobs that are very abstract and
generic; which gives the developer the freedom to use or even re-implement the functions to adapt to its requirements in the software.
Qt code when compiled the host operating system passes some of its properties and environment variable that the Qt uses to make the
code work on its platform. Our code runs straightaway in platforms like GNU/Linux, M S Windows and Apple MAC OSX kernels (more kernels 
to be experimented).
